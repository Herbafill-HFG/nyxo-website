This is the website that powers [nyxo.app](https://nyxo.app). It's built with the following tools:

- Gatsby
- React
- styled-components
- aws-amplify
- Netlify

## üöÄ Quick start

1. **Install the Gatsby CLI.**

   ```shell
   npm install -g gatsby-cli
   ```

2. **Setup AWS Amplify + envirnoment variables**

3. **Start the site in `develop` mode.**

Next, move into your new site‚Äôs directory and start it up:

   ```sh
   cd nyxo-website/
   gatsby develop
   ```

4. **Open the source code and start editing!**

Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`. Open the `Nyxo` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes, and the browser will update in real time!

At this point, you‚Äôve got a fully functional Gatsby website. For additional information on how you can customize your Gatsby site, see our [plugins](https://gatsbyjs.org/plugins/) and [the official tutorial](https://gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).
