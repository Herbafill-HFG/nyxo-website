Nyxo got accepted to Kiuas Accelerator! The program had a kick-off afternoon and its first BBQ this Wednesday. The summer of 17 startups started with an info session and a casual lunch with the teams, and a workshop around purpose and “why” of the companies, founders and their visions. As a cherry on top, the day got finished off with a BBQ with the Kiuas community.

“After a fantastic experience at Kiuas’ Start program this spring, applying to the accelerator was a no-brainer for us”, says [Perttu Lähteenlahti](https://lahteenlahti.com), CEO of Nyxo. Nyxo is amongst the youngest companies in the bunch after operating for only six months. Perttu continues: “Even though it’s not a competition, having the other teams there, right beside us, motivates us to work even harder to get our product and sales in better shape than ever.”

You can meet us at Kiuas BBQ’s at Startup Sauna this summer every other Wednesday (July 17th & 31st) and at Maria 01 on Wed August 14th! More information about the barbeques can be found on Kiuas’ Facebook page. The accelerator finishes with a bang with a Demo Day, organized on August 29th at Tennispalatsi ISENSE.
