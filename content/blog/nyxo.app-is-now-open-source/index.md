#### Hello world!

Today and I'm very excited to announce that we have just open source the Nyxo.app website, that means this one you're currently looking at. This is the first step in a larger project of making all Nyxo products open source. In the future, we will open-source more the things we've built here at Nyxo.

### What is Nyxo

In case this is the first time you've heard about Nyxo, let me introduce what we do. Founded in 2019, we build products to help you sleep better because we believe that sleep is the cornerstone of a healthy, happy, and fulfilling life. Our strategy for doing this is to provide something we call sleep coaching. Sleep coaching, which incorporates your sleep data to drive a four-week coaching program. Because we use data such as sleep records, heart rate, and daily activity to influence what type of coaching lessons and exercises are right for you, we work hard to support various sleep and activity trackers. You can also take part in the coaching without buying any tracker because the journey to better sleep, should not require an expensive upfront purchase.

We also strongly believe that a tightly knitted connection to sleep and behavioral research is the only way to develop coaching. Many in our team have a background in cognitive science or psychology, and we actively drive to be science-driven.

### Why We're Going Open Source

Since founding Nyxo, we've been planning to build the product in public and allow everyone to contribute to it. However, because we are building products that employ the user's well-being data, we were concerned about how privacy and security would work in open source settings. However, as time has shown, obscurity does not equal security, and when you're product makes use user's private data, you have to be transparent how that data is used. We've concluded that the best way to tackle both of these subjects is to be as open as possible. It will allow users to understand better how their data is used in our products and also allow us to learn from other people interested in contributing.

We also strongly believe that open source will allow us to build better products, solve more problems. Innovation, both radical and incremental, is not born out of a void, but out of interaction with the real world. Building a product that everyone can contribute to is a perfect way to do this.

Last but not least, we believe that open source will make Nyxo more resilient against time. This is the only way the product can outlive it's original creators, and the also the way to do things faster.

### Contributing

If you're interested in contributing to this website, you can find the repository for this website at [here](https://github.com/hello-nyxo/nyxo-website). All contributions are welcome, and we want contributing to our projects to be a fun and enjoyable experience for everyone. Contributing to Nyxo goes beyond pull requests and coding. We are happy to receive a variety of contributions, including the following:

1. Submitting new feature ideas
2. Submitting enhancements, designs, or bug fixes
3. Reporting bugs or issues
4. Blogging. If you're writing about the things we care about: sleeping, science, and technology, we would really love to have you on our blog. We accept previously released blog posts as well.
5. Contributing to the coaching materials we provide
6. Providing scientific backing to the coaching. If you're a researcher in the area of sleep and/or well-being, we would love to collaborate with you to create more coaching lessons and exercises. We would also love the highlight your research in our blog

### Coming Soon

As mentioned, this is just the first step. In the coming weeks, we are hoping to make the Nyxo mobile apps for Android and iOS open source as well. They're built with React Native, and we are quite proud of some of the things we've been able to achieve with that platform, but there are also things we would like other people to look at. There's no hard deadline for this, but we are hoping to do this before September.
